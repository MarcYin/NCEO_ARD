In this repo, I will show a demo of accessing early version of NCEO ARD (analysis ready data). This NCEO ARD is Sentinel 2 (S2) surface reflectance has been corrected for atmospheric effects by [SIAC](https://eartharxiv.org/ps957/). Following the [CEOS Analysis Ready Data](http://ceos.org/ard/), we want to provide *satellite data that have been processed to a minimum set of requirements and organized into a form that allows immediate analysis with a minimum of additional user effort and interoperability both through time and with other datasets*. Additionaly, we also want to ensure consistent surface reflectance between sensors, which is the core part of SIAC trying to achieve (for more details, please refer to [SIAC paper](https://eartharxiv.org/ps957/)). Another import aspect of SIAC is the efforts in propogating the uncertainty through out the processing chain to get per pixel level uncertainty information.

You can now access the NCEO ARD STAC browser through [https://marcyin.github.io/NCEO_ARD/](https://marcyin.github.io/NCEO_ARD/)
